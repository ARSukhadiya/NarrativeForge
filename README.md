# NarrativeForge ⚔️

Forge your own unique adventure! An interactive storytelling app where a generative AI crafts a dynamic narrative based on your choices. Built with a Python backend (LLM) and a native Swift frontend for iOS.

## 🎯 Project Overview

NarrativeForge is an interactive "choose your own adventure" style storytelling application where the narrative is dynamically generated by a large language model (LLM). Users make choices, and the AI generates the next part of the story, creating a unique narrative experience every time.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Story Generation**: AI-powered narrative creation using state-of-the-art language models
- **Interactive Choices**: Multiple choice system for story progression
- **Narrative Consistency**: Smart context management to maintain story coherence
- **Cross-Platform**: Python backend with native iOS Swift frontend
- **Real-time Generation**: Asynchronous story generation with loading indicators
- **Story Persistence**: Save and resume your adventures

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (Python)
- **LLM Integration**: Hugging Face Transformers with open-source models
- **Prompt Engineering**: Sophisticated prompt system for creative, consistent storytelling
- **Context Management**: Smart conversation history management
- **REST API**: FastAPI for iOS communication

### Frontend (iOS Swift)
- **Native UI**: SwiftUI for modern, responsive interface
- **Interactive Choices**: Touch-based story progression
- **Async Communication**: Seamless backend integration
- **Story Display**: Rich text rendering with animations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### iOS Setup
```bash
cd ios/NarrativeForge
open NarrativeForge.xcodeproj
```
